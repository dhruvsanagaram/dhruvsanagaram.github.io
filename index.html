          <strong>Hi there!</strong>
          My name is Dhruv Sanagaram and I am an aspiring software developer who
          loves building compelling software solutions. I am currenty a sophomore at the
          University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who studies Computer Engineering.
          <br><br><br>
          Web Development and Deep Learning are some of my many interests, and my experience
          with React.js, PyTorch, and other data parsing techniques have enabled me to become
          a well-rounded developer. My leadership experience in the Institute of Electrical
          and Electronics Engineers and Student Research of photonics have taught me invaluable
          lessons about communication, organization, and professionalism.
